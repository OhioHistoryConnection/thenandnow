"Then and Now" is an application designed to bring together Google Street Views
with historic photos stored in a CONTENTdm collection. It makes use of an SQLite
database (but could easily be substituted by any other means of storing/retrieving 
JSON data).

Implementation:

1) Your PHP installation must support the cURL and PDO_SQLITE.

2) The config_{$mapref}.php file must be filled out completely. {$mapref} is a short 
identifier for a geographical location. Example contents:

// server + path where this script resides
$config['THIS_HOST'] = "http://" . $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . "/thenandnow"; 
// URL for public-facing CONTENTdm host
$config['CONTENTDM_HOME'] = "http://www.contentdmhost.org";
// Path to SQLite db
$config['PATH_TO_SQLITE'] = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/thenandnow/data/test.db";
// address for CONTENTdm web services
$config['CDM_WEBSERVICES_HOME'] = "https://server00000.contentdm.oclc.org";
// any street address for example prompt value
$config['ADDRESS_PROMPT'] = "88 South High Street, Columbus, OH";
// any CDM Reference URL for example prompt value
$config['CDMURL_PROMPT'] = $config['CONTENTDM_HOME']."/cdm/ref/collection/[alias]/id/[ptr]";
// optional title that will appear on map
$config['MAP_TITLE'] = "Map of Downtown Columbus, Ohio";

3) The test.db database is a sample table with one blank JSON record in it. The 
name of the test map is "testmap", which is what you would type into the "Get 
Map Data" blank. To make your own database just make sure the table is 
named "maprecord" and that it contains two columns, one named "mapid", and the 
other named "mapdata". Although it is not necessary, if you need/want the rest of 
SQLite, visit their download page at http://www.sqlite.org/download.html.

4) To start a new map, type a title in the "Get Map Data" blank and click the
"Add Line" button.

Note: With the administrative files (get_data.php, do_query.php,
do_cdmquery.php) only basic data sanitization is being done. The administrative 
interface be run locally behind a firewall and the database can subsequently be 
uploaded to a publicly accessible site.

do make improvements on the application, however, please consider notifying me
